Questions i want to answer before building a model:
How many survived? Chart with a split between survived and deaths DONE

What is the split of tickets according to class i.e. what did the class structure onboard look like. DONE
Im thinking a pie chart to show it DONE

Is there a correlation between ticket class and survival? group by class then check survival numbers DONE
The 2 higher classes have a much higher chance of survival
For first class it has 136 survived vs 80 deaths
2nd has 87 vs 97
3rd has 119 survivals vs 372 deaths, so most deaths came from third class

What is the gender split? Group by gender then check survivals to see if gender played a role
for men it is 109 survivals vs 468 deaths
for women it is 233 survivals vs 81 deaths

Let's create some age groups and group them in that way so we can use the data
Also a distribution of ages first to see what it looked like
Then let's check by age group to see which age groups survied or died the most

When it comes to number of siblings/spouses and parents/children lets see if a higher number meant 
less chances of survival
Which age groups had the highest number of the last 2 categories
Which class had the highest number

Using the fare let's create a new column for the total amount paid for class*fare

cabin number im not too sure how to use

Did the embark location play a role? Let's group by embarked and check survival,class
