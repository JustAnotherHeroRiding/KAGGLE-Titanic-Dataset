    "\n",
    "Acquiring and exploring the data: This step involves downloading the train and test datasets from Kaggle and using tools such as pandas and matplotlib to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the variables and identify any patterns or missing data.\n",
    "For example, you can use the pandas library to load the train and test datasets into dataframes and use the .head() method to view the first few rows of the data. You can use the .info() method to get a summary of the dataframe, including the number of non-null values in each column, and the .describe() method to get a summary of the numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the matplotlib library to create visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to help you understand the distribution of the variables and identify patterns or outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning and preprocessing the data: This step involves handling missing values and outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical variables so that they can be used in the model.\n",
    "For example, if you find that a column has missing values, you may choose to fill in the missing values with the mean or median of the column. If you find outliers in the data, you may choose to remove them or replace them with a more reasonable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert categorical variables into numerical variables, you can use techniques such as one-hot encoding, which creates a new binary column for each unique category in a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering: This step involves creating new features by combining existing variables or by extracting useful information from the variables.\n",
    "For example, you can create a new feature by combining the \"Pclass\" and \"Fare\" columns to indicate the fare paid by a passenger in each class. You can also create new features by extracting useful information from the \"Name\" column, such as the title of a passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also group some data based on their similarity, for example the age, you can group them by age range (child, young, adult, senior) which can give more information to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that feature engineering is an iterative process, and you may need to go back and repeat step 2 and 3 multiple times to improve your model's performance."
